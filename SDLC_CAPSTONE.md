Section One - 
- It seems that the Waterfall method would be the most accurate to what the design of the game was. Even though there were more iterative phases, including going backward to polish and fix the game, the sprint still followed the design format. The group went down and did one step at a time, including coding, debugging, and design. Even though the process did go backward, it went back up to the beginning and refollowed the exact same process. 
Section Two - 
- Analysis of Requirements - The first step the group conducted was to analyze the requirements, and begin to create an overall idea of the project. 
- Design - Desgined the system, gameplay functions, how everything would work when playing
- Implementation - Creating code for the game, based on the design and requirements created in the first two steps. 
- Testing - Playing the game, making sure things actually work, and injecting errors into the code for the next QA team to discover 
- Deployment - Sending the game to the next team, then recieving errors that were created back to development team 
- Maintenance - Fixing errors that were found, including other errors that were not necessarily intended. 
Section Three - 
-Bug 1 - 
- 
- Since the phase it was in was the deployment/maintenance phase, the bugs being caught late don't particularly matter too much. It was still within the due date for the project, and end users being impacted wasn't too much of a big deal. Bugs being caught before a hard deadline is the most important thing.
Section Four -
- Our QA group found all of the errors towards the end of the phase. Testing was a large block of our time, so it made up the majority of the experience. It still followed the overall
